<!-- This where the actual tutorial begins. You don't need to write out the title again, having it in the frontmatter above is enough. -->

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my tutorial. There is not much you can do wrong so go ahead and have fun with your server. 
This Tutorial is written for the Hetzner Online Community Project.

**Prerequisites**

You need a Hetzner server. If you do not already have one, make sure to read step one before purchasing one. 

## Step 1 - Server Configuration

If you have not already, purchase a server. On the Configuration page, choose "Rescue-System" as the OS, we will later install Windows.
If you have already purchased a server, head to step 2 BUT save your Data from the server,!ALL FILES WILL BE DELETED!

## Step 2 - KVM

When your Server is online you can log in to your Robot. Head to the "Servers" tab and expand the server you would like to add your own License to. Click on the "Support" tab and as a request type choose Remote Console (KVM). I recommend requesting at least 2 Hours. You can also choose a time for when you want it. 
It is important that in the text field you specify that you would like to have a USB-Stick with a Windows Server (2008,2012,2016) (Datacenter, Standard) ISO loaded onto your Server.

## Step 3 - Installing Windows

After Support has finished setting up the KVM, you can now login by simply following the link, logging in and Download the file

Now you should see Windows installing.

When the Windows Setup starts, choose your keyboard and the language preferences you want and click on "continue".

Click on "Install now".

Choose the Windows variant you would like to use. IMPORTANT: You need to install the version with (Desktop view) behind the name, if you do not you will only get a command shell.  For this tutorial I used Windows Server 2016 Standard. Click on continue.

Accept the License and click on continue.

Now choose custom.

Click on the Hard drive you wish to install Windows to (In my case there is only one) and click continue.

Now you must wait for your Server to finish installing Windows.

Next, set a password for the Administrator account.

After this you can use your Server and have fun.
