## Introduction

Hello, I am going to show you how to install your own virtual Windows server on an existing Windows server.

**Prerequisites**

Open a Webbrowser and head to "http://mirror.hetzner.de/bootimages/windows/".
(This only works with a server located in Hetzner's Network (Like the backup spaces))

Choose your wanted Windows version and download the .iso file.

Additional IP (The buying process is going to be included in the tutorial)
Windows server (This tutorial works with Windows Server 2016, other versions could have differences)
Remote desktop connection to the Windows server

## Step 1 - Additional IP

This step is only needed if you have not already bought an additional IP, if you have, proceed with step 2.

Login in to your robot account (https://robot.your-server.de ), now click on server and click on the server on which you want to add the IP to.

When you expand your server, click on "IPs" and then on the grey button in the left bottom corner "Order additional IPs / networks".

Now choose "A paid IP (price (monthly): 1.00 € / Setup (once): 0.00 €)" and write as reason for the IP "Virtual Server".

When your IP order has arrived, proceed with step 2.


## Step 2 - Mac Address

Click on the Network icon right to the IP "Request separate MAC".

Now click on the red "Request separate MAC" Button, now you should see a Mac Adress which should look like this: MAC: 00:50:56:00:E5:7B

Copy and write down the MAC Address for later.

### Step 3 Hyper V Install

Login into your Windows Server via Remote desktop.

Start your server manager and click on "Add Role or feature"

Skip every side until you come to Server role, there you click on the "Hyper V" box and click Add Features.

Now Skip until you can press "install" after the install please restart your server once.

## Step 4 Setting up the Virtual Server

Start Hyper V, if you are not automatically connected right-click on Hyper V Manager and connect with your local computer.

Click at the right side on "New -> Virtual Computer".

Now choose a name, it can be any name, also you can assign a path where the VM should be installed to.
Click Next

Chose Generation 1.
Click Next

Now you can Setup the RAM of the Server, also you can activate Dynamic RAM which means that the Server does not use as an example, 16GB Ram, every time, the server uses the RAM it needs + 20% buffer if the server needs less RAM your main server will need less RAM too.
I chose for 16GB ram with Dynamic RAM.
Click Next

Leave the Network config on "Not Connected"
Click Next

Now you can choose which size your hard drive gonna have, windows needs about 25GB.
Also, you can edit the path.
Click Next

Now click on "Install OS Later"
Click Next

Click on "Finish"


Right Click on your new Virtual Machine and click on Settings.

Now you can edit your Hardware of the Server.

I would recommend to higher the core count for the install at least.

Head to Network card and chose your Virtual Switch connection.

After this expand "network card" by clicking the plus and go to extended Features.

Click on Static Mac Address and fill in your previous copied MAC Address then Click on "Apply" and "OK".

You can now assign how many cores your VM should be able to use.
For the install I would assign the core count that the system has minus one.
Also you could reassign RAM (8-12 GB should be more than enough).

Now head to "IDE-Controller 1" and click on "DVD Drive".

Click on an image file and now "search" the .iso you downloaded before.

Click "apply" and "ok"

## Step 5 Setting up Windows


Double-tap on your VM Name and then click on "Start".

Now you should see the Hyper V Logo following of Loading files and a Windows Logo.

When the Windows Setup started chose your Keyboard and language preferences you want and click on "continue".

Click on "Install now".

Chose the Windows Variant you would like for its Windows Server 2016 Standard (IMPORTANT you need to install the version with (Desktop view) behind the name, without this you only get a command Shell, click on continue.

Accept the License and click on continue


Now take custom

Click on the Harddrive you want to install windows to (In my case there is only one), click continue.

Now is your Server installing Windows, until its finished don't Shutdown or suspend the VM or Host system.

In the next step, the Administrator password has to be typed in twice.

After this, you can use your VM and have fun.

Host System = Your Dedicated Server where the Virtual Machine is running on.
